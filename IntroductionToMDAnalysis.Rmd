# Introduction to MDAnalysis 


- **MDAnalysis** is an object-oriented Python package to analyze Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories. 
- The atomic coordinates can be accessed through NumPy arrays.
- Data can be read or written in the pdb and dcd formats.
- CHARMM-like atom selection syntax makes it easier to learn for those who are used to VMD.


# Introduction to MDAnalysis

- Please visit <https://www.mdanalysis.org> for its installation guide and documentation. 
- *MDAnalysis: A Toolkit for the Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Simulations* (DOI: 10.1002/jcc.21787) explains the structure of the code in detail.

# Outline
In this workshop, we will learn how to:

- load a structure or a MD trajectory;
- select parts of your system;
- work with atoms, residues and molecules through the object-oriented interface of MDAnalysis;
- analyze MD trajectories;
- write out modified trajectories;
- use algorithms in the MDAnalysis.analysis module (intermediate level of difficulty).

# Loading a structure and its trajectory:
- First, we need to import MDAnalysis and NumPy packages.
- Then, we will specify the structure file (either pdb or psf) and its trajectory file (dcd) with their proper pathways.
- Finally, we will build the *AtomGroup* of our molecular system by loading a topology and a trajectory into the central data structure, the *Universe* object:
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3', cache=FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
import MDAnalysis
import numpy as np
PSF = "Example/structure.psf" 
DCD = "Example/trajectory.dcd"
p = MDAnalysis.Universe(PSF,DCD)
print(p.atoms)
```
Note that MDAnalysis is object oriented. Molecular systems consist of *Atom* objects, which are grouped in *AtomGroup* instances are built as the *Universe* objects.

# Handling a molecular system
Once we have the *Universe()* object, we can select atoms using a CHARMM-like syntax.
But, before doing that, let's check the following:

- the number of atoms;
- the list of atoms;
- the first 5 atoms;
- the list of segments in the system;
- the list of residues involving the given atom indices. 

```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
print(p)
print(p.atoms)
list(p.atoms[:5])
list(p.atoms.segments)
list(p.atoms[430:450])
```


# Handling a molecular system
From smaller to larger, organizational units can be listed as *Atom*, *Residue*, and *Segment*. Similarly, each higher level organizational unit also knows about the smaller ones. In other words, each *Residue* has *Atoms*.

```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
sel = p.atoms[430:450].residues
sel.atoms
```

# Exercise
1. Print out the residue (*resname*) of the last atom in the selection previously defined as `sel`.
2. What does the following expression return? Why?
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
len(p.atoms[430:450]) == len(p.atoms[430:450].residues.atoms) 
```
3. How many residues are in the *Universe* `p`? How do you get a list of the residue names (such as ["Ala", "Gly", "Gly", "Asp", ...]) and residue numbers (*resid*) for atoms 430 to 450? And as a list of tuples (resname, resid)? *Hint:* You can search for **zip** function.

4. How many segments are there? What is the segment identifier of the first *Segment*?


# Exercise (Solutions)
1. Print out the residue (*resname*) of the last atom in the selection previously defined as `sel`.
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
sel.atoms[-1]
```

2. What does the following expression return? Why?
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
len(p.atoms[430:450]) == len(p.atoms[430:450].residues.atoms)
```
It returns `FALSE` since the length of the atoms is not equal to the length of the complete residues. The complete residues have more atoms than the arbitrary slice of atoms.

# Exercise (Solutions)
3. How many residues are in the *Universe* `p`?  How do you get a list of the residue names (such as ["Ala", "Gly", "Gly", "Asp", ...]) and residue numbers (*resid*) for atoms 430 to 450? And as a list of tuples (resname, resid)? *Hint:* You can search for **zip** function.
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
len(p.residues)
resnames = p.atoms[430:450].residues.resnames
resids = p.atoms[430:450].residues.resids
list(zip(resnames, resids))
```
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3', echo=FALSE}
nres=len(p.residues)                                        
``` 
There are `r py$nres` residues in the given system.

4. How many segments are there? What is the segment identifier of the first *Segment*?
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
len(p.segments)
segnames = p.segments
si = segnames[0].segid
```
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3', echo=FALSE}
nseg=len(p.segments)
```
There are `r py$nseg` segments in the given system. The segment identifier (*segid*) of the first *Segment* is `r as.character(py$si)`. Note that `len(p.segments)`, `len(p.atoms.segments)` and `p.atoms.n_segments` are interchangeable.

# Selections
- The `select_atoms` method of an *AtomGroup* or a *Universe* returns an *AtomGroup* and the selections are alwaus sorted according to their index in the topology file. 
```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
p.select_atoms("segid PROA")
```
This selects all the protein atoms.

- The following keywords are understood by the selection parser:
  - protein, backbone, nucleic, nucleicbackbone
  - segid *seg-name*
  - resid *residue-number-or-range*
  - resname *3-letter aa code*
  - name *atom name*
  - atom *seg-name residue-number atom-name*
